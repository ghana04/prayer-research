# Mark

## Mark 1:35 | Early in the morning

*35 And rising very early in the morning, while it was still dark, he departed and went out to a desolate place, and there he prayed.*

Jesus got up early to pray because it guaranteed alone time.
Being dark, His movement would have been unnoticed by others. 

All of this gave Him enough time to pray before others would find Him and the interaction with people would resume.
This would also have sent a strong signal to His disciples on how much He valued prayer, they would find Him alone and probably know that He was there to pray, setting the example for them.

- **Where**: Alone in a desolate place

## [P] Mark 6:46 | Alone on a mountain 

Parallel to Matthew 14:22-33

## Mark 9:29 | This kind can only be driven out by prayer

*And he said to them, "This kind cannot be driven out by anything but prayer."*

Prayer is here the only possible route for an 'impossible' spiritual battle.

Reminds me of the story of Carole Ward, who by praying with other believers essentially drove out a demonic terrorist from Uganda.

## [P] Mark 11:17 | House of prayer for the nations

Parallel to Matthew 21:13

## Mark 11:24-25

*24 Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.*
*25 And whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone, so that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.*

Jesus highlights two very important components that must go hand-in-hand with prayer: 

1. Faith that you will receive what you ask for (James 1:6, "with no doubting")
2. Forgiveness toward others.

Faith and forgiveness.
Let us ask in proportion to our faith, and let us forgive as we draw near to God, that we may receive forgiveness from Him.

- **Manner**: By faith, with forgiveness toward others.

## Mark 12:40 | For pretense make long prayers

*who devour widows' houses and for a pretense make long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation.*

Long prayers is a way evil people try to portray themselves as virtuous!
We are to avoid long prayers before others, because it's actually typical of those who are not believers (cf. Matthew 6:7).

Rather, our prayers are to be filled with faith in God who already knows what we need and won't hear us for our many words (our righteousness), but because we are united to His Son who is already praying on our behalf.

## [P] Mark 13:18 | Pray that it may not happen in winter

Parallel to Matthew 24:20.

## [P] Mark 14:32-39 | Prayer in Gethsemane

Parallel to Matthew 26:36-45

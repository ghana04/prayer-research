# 2 Corinthians

## 2 Corinthians 1:11

_11 You also must help us by prayer, so that many will give thanks on our behalf for the blessing granted us through the prayers of many._

Difficult passage to translate.
Technically the Greek word typically used for prayer is not mentioned here, but prayer (or supplication) is inferred from δεήσει.

Paul really sees this congregation working together with him by prayer.
Not only are they not to be jealous of the gift given to Paul and his companions, but they are to pray that this gift would be used in such a way that it would abound in thanksgiving from others.

- **Beneficiaries:** For Paul, for the eventual benefit of other believers
- **Content:** Supplication
- **Why:** That despite challenges faced by Paul and his companions, the Lord would supplicate what is needed for them to minister to others.

## 2 Corinthians 9:14

_14 while they long for you and pray for you, because of the surpassing grace of God that is upon you._

Prayer for one another in the body is an outflow of our love for one another.
This is evident in the Macedonians, who 'long for' the people of Corinth.

This is probably also true of people today that receive donations: this expression of love makes them (in turn) long for the company of those who are so gracious to them.
In their love for the Corinthians, the Macedonians pray for them.

- **Beneficiaries:** The Corinthian church
- **Why:** Because of the grace of God that is upon them

## 2 Corinthians 13:7-9

_7 But we pray to God that you may not do wrong—not that we may appear to have met the test, but that you may do what is right, though we may seem to have failed._
_8 For we cannot do anything against the truth, but only for the truth._
_9 For we are glad when we are weak and you are strong._
_Your restoration is what we pray for._

- **Beneficiaries:** For the Corinthian church
- **Content:** Supplication (for them to act rightly and be restored/made complete)
- **Manner:** As a group of people ("we")
- **To whom:** God
- **Why:** That the Corinthians may do what is right

Paul wants the Corinthians to act in such a wat that demonstrates that they pass the test (verse 5).
In other words, in accordance with the Truth, who lives inside of them ("Jesus Christ is in you").

This might be interpreted as Paul wanting affirmation via their behavior of his apostolic test.
But he refuses this accusation, since he is just interested in their behavior aligning with the truth (verse 8).
So much so, that he would rather have them be strong and he himself be weak.

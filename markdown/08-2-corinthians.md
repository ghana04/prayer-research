## 2 Corinthians 1:11

_11 You also must help us by prayer, so that many will give thanks on our behalf for the blessing granted us through the prayers of many._

Difficult passage to translate.
Technically the Greek word typically used for prayer is not mentioned here, but prayer (or supplication) is inferred from δεήσει.

Paul really sees this congregation working together with him by prayer.
Not only are they not to be jealous of the gift given to Paul and his companions, but they are to pray that this gift would be used in such a way that it would abound in thanksgiving from others.

- **Beneficiaries:** For Paul, for the eventual benefit of other believers
- **Content:** Supplication
- **Why:** That despite challenges faced by Paul and his companions, the Lord would supplicate what is needed for them to minister to others.

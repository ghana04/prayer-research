# 1 Timothy

## 1 Timothy 2:1-2 | Prayers for all people

_1 First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people,_
_2 for kings and all who are in high positions,_
_that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life,_
_godly and dignified in every way._

- **Beneficiaries:** All people, especially kings and those in high positions
- **Content:** Supplications, intercessions, and thanksgivings
- **Why:** That the Church may lead a peaceful and quiet life, and for salvation of unbelievers

The first thing that Paul wants Timothy to encourage in the believers is prayer.
Let us not encourage all other forms of things, if not prayer.

## 1 Timothy 2:8 | I desire that the men should pray

_8 I desire that in every place the men should pray, lifting holy hands, without anger or quarreling;_

- **Manner:** Lifting holy hands, without anger or quarreling
- **Where:** Every place where the believers gather

I see this as Paul encouraging the men to do what they would be tempted not to (pray, be peaceable), as he addresses a similar thing for women in the next verse.

## 1 Timothy 4:4-5 | Made holy by prayer

_4 For everything created by God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving,_
_5 for it is made holy by the word of God and prayer._

- **Beneficiaries:** The things received by believers
- **Content:** Thanksgiving (likely)
- **Why:** To make that which is received appropriate for the new testament priest

## 1 Timothy 5:5 | True widows pray

_5 She who is truly a widow, left all alone, has set her hope on God_
_and continues in supplications and prayers night and day,_
_6 but she who is self-indulgent is dead even while she lives._

- **Content:** Supplications and general
- **When:** Night and day

Two fascinating deductions about prayer, in this context about widows but surely also broader.

1. It goes hand-in-hand with someone who has set their hope on God.
2. It is contrasted with someone who is self-indulgent.

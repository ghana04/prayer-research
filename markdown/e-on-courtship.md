# On courtship

What does it mean to court a woman, based off the example of Christ and His bride.

## Day 1 - Courtship must stem from a relationship with the Father

All throughout the ministry of Jesus, His way of interacting with His bride was connected to the Father:

- He spoke to them the words of the Father (John 17:14).
- He acted before them in a way that pleased the Father (John 8:29).
- He saw His bride as belonging to the Father (John 17:10).
- He was always aware of the presence of the Father (John 8:29).
- He desired that His disciples should have something of that which He already had with the Father (John 17:21).

His pursuit of His bride originated in the Father (John 3:16) and was determined by the Father (John 17:12).
Thus, Jesus didn't see His pursuit of His bride as a mission on one side, and the relationship with His Father as something on the other side.

Whoever we court as a Christian should also be a Christian (1 Corinthians 8:39).
With that in place, our highest aim should not stem from our dreams for the future, our ambitions, or even our desires.
When pursuing a woman, the highest aim should be bringing her into that which we have with the Father.

I don't believe it means that the Father will prescribe every step (doesn't feel right when a human father does that).
But I do believe that as far as it depends on us, we must have a relationship with the Father that at least we are excited to bring a woman into.

If our relationship with the Father does not excite and motivate us, how can we lead a woman into it?

## Day 2 - Jesus has an end in mind for His bride

Jesus did not just bring His disciples on the journey that He was going with the Father.
He did not simply have them come along and hope in a vague way that they would grow into something more.
He had an intention, He was active in doing what He knew He should but also with the end in mind.

What was the end for Jesus?

For Simon: It was to make him a fisher of men (Matthew 4:19).
In a sense, to 'upgrade' the vocation of Simon.

For the group:

1. That they should do just as Jesus does (John 13:15)
2. That they should bear witness (John 15:27)
3. That they may have peace (John 16:33)
4. That they may have eternal life (John 17:2)
5. That they may have His joy (John 17:13)
6. That they may be sanctified in the truth (John 17:18)
7. That they may have glory, that they may be one (John 17:22)
8. That the love of God, and Jesus Christ, may be in them (John 17:26)

How does this happen?

1. "I haven given you an example" (John 13:15).
2. Through observation of Jesus and the empowering of the Holy Spirit.
3. "I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace." (John 16:33)
4. By knowing God the Father and Jesus Christ whom He has sent (John 17:3).
5. "these things I speak in the world" (John 17:13).
6. By Jesus going ahead of them in sanctifying Himself, "for their sake I consecrate myself" (John 17:18)
7. By Jesus giving it as a gift (John 17:22).
8. By Jesus making known to them the name of His Father, "I made known ... and will continue to make it known" (John 17:26).

In summary:
Jesus is constantly pouring into His disciples, whether through example or through speech.
He wants them to have certain things, such as love, joy, and peace.
He also wants them to act in certain ways, following His example always.

One of the most profound things about the relationship between Jesus and His bride is again the principle of Jesus being the one that goes ahead.
He consecrates Himself, so that the disciples also may be sanctified in the truth. 
This is not acting 'on them', but doing something 'to Himself' that in some way will translate to His bride.

Peace and joy comes through the words of Jesus.
Love and life comes through knowing God.
Bearing witness comes through the Holy Spirit.
Consecration to God comes through a transcendent reality of Christ having gone before.
Imitation of Christ comes through observation of Christ.
Glory comes as a gift.

## Day 3 - Jesus brings His bride into His mission

The mission of Jesus was bigger than the disciples.
The disciples became part of the mission, not the mission becoming part of the disciples.

As with Adam in the garden, the second Adam had a task from the Father.
Even when his disciples wanted to suggest another route, because He knew what He was called to do he choose the Father's route and took them along.

How does that look like for us? For me?
In the New Testament, the emphasis seems much less on 'being somewhere' than 'being someone'.
It's not that God is calling us to go a certain place as much as He is calling us to become a certain people.

Where does God want us to go to? 

1. Walk by the Spirit
2. Take up your cross
3. Rejoice always
4. Pray without ceasing
5. Give thanks in all circumstances
6. Associate with the lowly
7. Be self-controlled

For us, we are to bring our brides into the mission we have.
Even for Jesus, He learned obedience through what He suffered.
He experienced resurrection after crucifixion.
In that sense, He became obedient (Philippians 2:8), He was made perfect (Hebrews 5:9).

As we as men approach courtship, the idea should be to bring our brides into our mission.
That mission should be primarily focused on character, although as with Christ it can have location or lifestyle aspects.

## Day 4 - Jesus doesn't start, or typically choose, that which is already esteemed in the world

In fact, He chooses the disciples from all walks of life.
Even in the natural, Paul says to the Corinthians that most of them were not considered:

- Wise according to worldly standards
- Powerful
- Of noble birth

This is what God chooses:

- That which is foolish in the world
- That which is weak in the world
- That which is low and despised
- That which is not

In all these things, there is an opportunity for God to be exalted.
God shows himself to be exalted amidst the false pride of men, by triumphing over them through that which they pridefully disregarded.

Maybe part of the reason, or even the reason, that an excellent wife is the crown of her husband, is that it reflects something of the husband's way with her.
The husband is glorified in a flourishing wife.

## Day 5 - Jesus brings His bride into faith

The road Jesus walks is full of trials and tests.
He would even ask impossible things of His disciples.
And when He encounters faith, he rejoices in it and celebrates it!

The trials are not arbitrary, but great opportunities to diagnose the faith in those who experience them.

Therefore for us, we should seek to turn everything that we do during courtship also into an opportunity for faith.
First in ourselves, but also in the other.
When plans don't go as we wish -- have faith!
When trials tempt us to stop being thankful and rejoicing -- have faith!
When earthly treasures are lost -- have faith!

Then, as we become men who operate on faith, it will be blessing to our households.
We should encourage faith (John 14:1), celebrate it (Matthew 15:12), cultivate it (Matthew 14:29), pray for it (Luke 22:32). 

## Day 6 - Jesus goes as the Father leads, teaching the bride on the way

Jesus was not primarily driven by customs or human concerns.
He was driven by the Father and the mission he would fulfill for the Father.

_48 And when his parents saw him, they were astonished._
_And his mother said to him, “Son, why have you treated us so?_
_Behold, your father and I have been searching for you in great distress.”_
_49 And he said to them, “Why were you looking for me?_
_Did you not know that I must be in my Father's house?”_
_50 And they did not understand the saying that he spoke to them._

The greater purpose, His calling, keeps Him in Bethany while Lazarus is sick, so that the Father may be glorified.
This goes against the expectations of the people, and even seems loveless to them (John 11:36-37).
Even going back is against the hopes of the disciples, since they warn Him of the threat of the Jews that wants to kill Him.
So, while some were hoping that we would have gone back sooner, and others wanting Him not to go back at all, Jesus goes later so that the Father may be glorified.

The greater purpose, His calling, makes Him go away from Capernaum while everything there is searching for Him (Mark 1:37-38).
This probably went against the hopes of the people of Capernaum, that He might stay there.
But Jesus is driven by the mission and purpose He received from the Father (Mark 1:38).

Even when talking to His disciples about the future, He speaks of heaven as His Father's house, where He goes to prepare a room for them.

So as He was on the journey, as He was doing the things that pleased the Father, He took His disciples along with Him and taught them.

## Day 7 - Jesus shares His emotions with His bride, but wrestles it out with His Father

Jesus' emotions were communicated through actions and words.
Here is a list of actions:

1. Rejoicing in the Holy Spirit (Luke 10:21).
2. Weeping at the tomb of Lazarus (John 11:35).

Here is a list of words:

1. How great is my distress (Luke 12:50).
2. Now my soul is troubled (John 12:27).

However, this moments of grief and distress didn't immobilize Him.
Right after weeping He went over to actions of faith, giving instructions for the stone to be rolled away in preparation for the resurrection.
Right after saying that His distress is great, and that His soul is troubled, He continued teaching and rebuking.

Where He was 'stopped' was in the deep prayer with the Father right before the crucifixion.
This was where He bared His anxiety, a godly anxiety, and worked through it.
After returning to His disciples, He was back to leading them and going ahead with the mission.

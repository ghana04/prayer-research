# On courtship

What does it mean to court a woman, based off the example of Christ and His bride.

## Day 1 - Courtship must stem from a relationship with the Father

All throughout the ministry of Jesus, His way of interacting with His bride was connected to the Father:

- He spoke to them the words of the Father (John 17:14).
- He acted before them in a way that pleased the Father (John 8:29).
- He saw His bride as belonging to the Father (John 17:10).
- He was always aware of the presence of the Father (John 8:29).
- He desired that His disciples should have something of that which He already had with the Father (John 17:21).

His pursuit of His bride originated in the Father (John 3:16) and was determined by the Father (John 17:12).
Thus, Jesus didn't see His pursuit of His bride as a mission on one side, and the relationship with His Father as something on the other side.

Whoever we court as a Christian should also be a Christian (1 Corinthians 8:39).
With that in place, our highest aim should not stem from our dreams for the future, our ambitions, or even our desires.
When pursuing a woman, the highest aim should be bringing her into that which we have with the Father.

I don't believe it means that the Father will prescribe every step (doesn't feel right when a human father does that).
But I do believe that as far as it depends on us, we must have a relationship with the Father that at least we are excited to bring a woman into.

If our relationship with the Father does not excite and motivate us, how can we lead a woman into it?

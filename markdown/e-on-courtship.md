# On courtship

What does it mean to court a woman, based off the example of Christ and His bride.

## Day 1 - Courtship must stem from a relationship with the Father

All throughout the ministry of Jesus, His way of interacting with His bride was connected to the Father:

- He spoke to them the words of the Father (John 17:14).
- He acted before them in a way that pleased the Father (John 8:29).
- He saw His bride as belonging to the Father (John 17:10).
- He was always aware of the presence of the Father (John 8:29).
- He desired that His disciples should have something of that which He already had with the Father (John 17:21).

His pursuit of His bride originated in the Father (John 3:16) and was determined by the Father (John 17:12).
Thus, Jesus didn't see His pursuit of His bride as a mission on one side, and the relationship with His Father as something on the other side.

Whoever we court as a Christian should also be a Christian (1 Corinthians 8:39).
With that in place, our highest aim should not stem from our dreams for the future, our ambitions, or even our desires.
When pursuing a woman, the highest aim should be bringing her into that which we have with the Father.

I don't believe it means that the Father will prescribe every step (doesn't feel right when a human father does that).
But I do believe that as far as it depends on us, we must have a relationship with the Father that at least we are excited to bring a woman into.

If our relationship with the Father does not excite and motivate us, how can we lead a woman into it?

## Day 2 - Jesus has an end in mind for His bride

Jesus did not just bring His disciples on the journey that He was going with the Father.
He did not simply have them come along and hope in a vague way that they would grow into something more.
He had an intention, He was active in doing what He knew He should but also with the end in mind.

What was the end for Jesus?

For Simon: It was to make him a fisher of men (Matthew 4:19).
In a sense, to 'upgrade' the vocation of Simon.

For the group:

1. That they should do just as Jesus does (John 13:15)
2. That they should bear witness (John 15:27)
3. That they may have peace (John 16:33)
4. That they may have eternal life (John 17:2)
5. That they may have His joy (John 17:13)
6. That they may be sanctified in the truth (John 17:18)
7. That they may have glory, that they may be one (John 17:22)
8. That the love of God, and Jesus Christ, may be in them (John 17:26)

How does this happen?

1. "I haven given you an example" (John 13:15).
2. Through observation of Jesus and the empowering of the Holy Spirit.
3. "I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace." (John 16:33)
4. By knowing God the Father and Jesus Christ whom He has sent (John 17:3).
5. "these things I speak in the world" (John 17:13).
6. By Jesus going ahead of them in sanctifying Himself, "for their sake I consecrate myself" (John 17:18)
7. By Jesus giving it as a gift (John 17:22).
8. By Jesus making known to them the name of His Father, "I made known ... and will continue to make it known" (John 17:26).

In summary:
Jesus is constantly pouring into His disciples, whether through example or through speech.
He wants them to have certain things, such as love, joy, and peace.
He also wants them to act in certain ways, following His example always.

One of the most profound things about the relationship between Jesus and His bride is again the principle of Jesus being the one that goes ahead.
He consecrates Himself, so that the disciples also may be sanctified in the truth. 
This is not acting 'on them', but doing something 'to Himself' that in some way will translate to His bride.

Peace and joy comes through the words of Jesus.
Love and life comes through knowing God.
Bearing witness comes through the Holy Spirit.
Consecration to God comes through a transcendent reality of Christ having gone before.
Imitation of Christ comes through observation of Christ.
Glory comes as a gift.

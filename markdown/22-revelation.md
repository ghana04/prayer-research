# Revelation

## Revelation 5:58 | 

_8 And when he had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb,_
_each holding a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints._

No analysis, as it's not a description of prayer itself.

## Revelation 8:3-4 | 

_3 And another angel came and stood at the altar with a golden censer,_
_and he was given much incense to offer with the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar before the throne,_
_4 and the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, rose before God from the hand of the angel._

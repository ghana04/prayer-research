# Matthew

## Matthew 5:44 | Praying for enemies
But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven.

- **Beneficiaries**: Our enemies, those who persecute us. 
- **Why**: To be like our Heavenly Father, who gives good to the just and unjust.

## Matthew 6:5-8 | Praying in secret

5 “And when you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites. For they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, that they may be seen by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward. 6 But when you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.
7 “And when you pray, do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do, for they think that they will be heard for their many words. 8 Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.

- Two times “when you pray”: Jesus expects his followers to pray, it’s “when” not “if”.
- Every prayer has a reward: either recognition from men, or a reward from your Father.

- **To whom**: Our Heavenly Father
- **Where**: In the secret place where no one knows we are praying.
- **Beneficiaries**: Unspecified, but ultimately also the believer who is prayer.

## Matthew 6:9-13 | Our Father

9 Pray then like this:
“Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
10 Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
11 Give us this day our daily bread,
12 and forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.
13 And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.

- **To whom**: Our Heavenly Father
- **Beneficiaries**: 
  - God
  - Ourselves (believers)
- **Content**: A series of entreaties

## Matthew 9:38 | Labourers

*37 Then he said to his disciples, “The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few; 38 therefore pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest.”*

Jesus' instruction for 'evangelistic' prayer is not for the people to be changed, but for the Father to send out more laborers.

- **To whom**: The Lord of the harvest
- **Beneficiaries**: For the harvest (the lost).

## Matthew 11:25-26 | Jesus thanks God for revealing to little children

_25 At that time Jesus declared, “I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to little children;_
_26 yes, Father, for such was your gracious will._

Jesus spontaneously starts thanking the Father in prayer.
His prayer is similar to that in John 11, where He also starts off by thanking the Father.
In this case, He also adds a descriptor, "Lord of heaven and earth".

- **To whom**: The Father
- **Where**: Before the disciples

From the parallel passage in Luke 10:21, we also see that this prayer occurred because Jesus "rejoiced in the Holy Spirit".
This is encouraging because on the surface the fact that many are rejecting Jesus is not a cause for rejoicing.
If everyone turning to Jesus was the cause for rejoicing then there would be a constant lamentation.
Through the power and revelation of the Spirit, we can also rejoice when: 

- Our physical goods are plundered (Hebrews 10:34)
- We encounter trails of various kinds (James 1:2-4)
- We are grieved (1 Peter 1:6-7)
- Always (1 Thessalonians 5:16)

Jesus could engage with a rebellious and frustrating people/situation, and in that same hour erupt in praise by the Holy Spirit.
The praise resulted not from the circumstance per se, but from a deduction related to the circumstance: that God's ways and wisdom is manifested in this situation.

That which Jesus is rejoicing in is not a specific application (e.g. "you have not revealed this to Justin"), but a general truth that is always at work.

Wow!
In 1 Thessalonians 5, after speaking about rejoicing and giving thanks, the Spirit is mentioned: "Do not quench the Spirit" (v. 9).
If Jesus quenched the Spirit, He would probably not have been rejoicing.

## Matthew 14:22-23 | Jesus praying on the mountain

*22 Immediately he made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowds. 23 And after he had dismissed the crowds, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone,*

Jesus made time to pray alone.

- **Where**: Alone on a mountain
- **When**: Before evening, maybe also during evening

## Matthew 19:13 | Children brought to Jesus for prayer

*Then children were brought to him that he might lay his hands on them and pray.*

Laying hands on someone and praying is part of walking in the steps of Jesus.
These children were not believers, but represented something of what a believer must have (childlike faith).

- **Beneficiaries**: Children

## Matthew 21:13 | My house shall be called a house of prayer

*He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer,' but you make it a den of robbers."*

The gathering of God's people is to be so marked by prayer that it be called according to it. 
Not 'a house of worship', not 'a house of evangelism', not 'a house of missions', not 'a house of miracles', but 'a house of prayer'.

We as believers in the New Testament are the house of God.
We are to be a praying people. 

## Matthew 21:22 | You will receive if you have faith

*And whatever you ask in prayer, you will receive, if you have faith.*

- **Manner**: By faith

## Matthew 24:20 | Pray that it would not be on a Sabbath or in winter

*Pray that your flight may not be in winter or on a Sabbath*

It is fixed that the tribulation will occur, but Jesus encourages his disciples to pray that God would let it happen at a time that will be less difficult to handle.

- **Beneficiaries**: Believers

## Matthew 26:36-45 | Prayer in Gethsemane

*36 Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, “Sit here, while I go over there and pray.”*
*37 And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be sorrowful and troubled.*
*38 Then he said to them, “My soul is very sorrowful, even to death; remain here, and watch with me.”*
*39 And going a little farther he fell on his face and prayed, saying, “My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will.”*
*40 And he came to the disciples and found them sleeping. And he said to Peter, “So, could you not watch with me one hour?*
*41 Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.”*
*42 Again, for the second time, he went away and prayed, “My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it, your will be done.”*
*43 And again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.*
*44 So, leaving them again, he went away and prayed for the third time, saying the same words again.*
*45 Then he came to the disciples and said to them, “Sleep and take your rest later on. See, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.*

- Though there is time for praying in secret when no one knows about it, there is also time for telling people "wait here, I'm going to pray first". 
- Jesus reveals his heart to his closer disciples, telling them what emotion He is experiencing and asking them to "watch" with Him, which is associated with prayer.
- Therefore, to be alert (watching) is to be in prayer.

> *The end of all things is at hand: therefore be self-controlled and sober-minded for the sake of your prayers.* ~ 1 Peter 4:7

Regarding the content of Jesus' prayer:

- **Beneficiaries**: The Son (possible)
- **Content**: Question (if possible, let), followed by an entreaty.

Regarding Jesus' interaction with the sleeping disciples:

- To watch and pray is cited as a way of not entering into temptation.
- It seems to be linked to the strengthening of the spirit of the one who prays, to help overcome the weak flesh.
- Most likely it's the same for us as well, that we are to watch and pray so that our petition to God to not be lead into temptation may be fulfilled.

Jesus prays the same prayer three times in relatively short succession.
At then end, He seems to have come to know that the will of the Father is indeed that He should take the path of the cross.

> It is as if repeated time with the Father in prayer has brought resolution and instilled the necessary clarity and resolve needed to go forward in the Spirit.
> This is similar to Paul, who prayed three times that God would remove the thorn in his flesh (2 Cor 12:7-10), which brought a revelation/answer that was also the resolution.

## Matthew 27:46 | Why have you forsaken me?

_46 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, “Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?” that is, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”_

- **Where:** On the cross, in the middle of a time of intense suffering
- **To whom:** The Father
- **What:** Lamentation
- **Why:** Maybe to process the intense feelings of neglect associated with suffering, but certainly also to point to Himself as the fulfillment of Scripture
- **How:** With a loud voice, also in Hebrew and using repetition, quoting OT Scripture

# Acts

## Acts 1:14 Disciples pray with one accord

_14 All these with one accord were devoting themselves to prayer, together with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brothers._

We should also as groups _devote_ ourselves to prayer.

- **How**: Corporately as believers

## Acts 1:24-25 |  Disciples pray for replacement

_24 And they prayed and said, “You, Lord, who know the hearts of all, show which one of these two you have chosen_
_25 to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside to go to his own place.”_

This prayer seems to pick up two things from the life of Jesus:

1. Parenthetical descriptor: The disciples follow the example of Jesus in Matthew 11:25 where the prayer starts by addressing God and adding a descriptor.
   This also is the pattern taught in the Our Father prayer.
   However, naturally not a fixed rule, for example in the gospel of John Jesus would often add a statement of truth (rather than description) after addressing God.
2. Brevity: The disciples have naturally been praying a long while, as Jesus would have prayed through the night.
   But in this instance, the prayer is very short, as Jesus taught.

In this prayer as well, there is again 'statements of fact', such as "from which Judas turned aside to go to his own place".
In other words, knowing God is omniscient does not eradicate the natural conversational style that we would employ when speaking to one another, which does include giving context and describing situations.
However, there is never the sense that they are informing God, they just state what should already be known.

- **To whom**: The Lord.
  Difficult to know if Jesus was explicitly addressed, as Luke uses "Lord" regularly for both the Father and the Son.
- **Content**: Entreaty for guidance
- **Why**: To fulfill Scripture as it relates to the work of the ministry.

## Acts 2:42 | Devoted themselves to prayer

_24 And they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers._

Again, prayer is brought up in the context of "devoting".
We need to devote ourselves to prayer.

- **How**: Corporately as believers

## Acts 3:1 | At the temple at the hour of prayer

_1 Now Peter and John were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour._

Part of devoting themselves to prayer seemed to be to go to 'prayer events', even in the systems (Temple) that were frequented by those who "killed the Author of life" (v. 15).
Furthermore, this temple was under the jurisdiction of the "council" (4:15), those who "crucified" (v. 10) and "rejected" (v. 11) Jesus.

Clearly Peter and John were able to operate within a place filled with unsanctified people, maybe especially because the purpose of that specific time was prayer.
It seems that their understanding that "you acted in ignorance" (v. 17) enabled them to be in their midst.

- **How**: Corporately, even in the presence of the ignorant

## Acts 4:24-31 | Prayer for boldness

_23 When they were released, they went to their friends and reported what the chief priests and the elders had said to them._
_24 And when they heard it, they lifted their voices together to God and said,_
_“Sovereign Lord, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and everything in them,_
_25 who through the mouth of our father David, your servant, said by the Holy Spirit,_

_“‘Why did the Gentiles rage,_
    _and the peoples plot in vain?_
_26 The kings of the earth set themselves,_
    _and the rulers were gathered together,_
    _against the Lord and against his Anointed’ —_

_27 for truly in this city there were gathered together against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel,_
_28 to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place._
_29 And now, Lord, look upon their threats and grant to your servants to continue to speak your word with all boldness,_
_30 while you stretch out your hand to heal, and signs and wonders are performed through the name of your holy servant Jesus.”_
_31 And when they had prayed, the place in which they were gathered together was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and continued to speak the word of God with boldness._

- **To whom:** God the Father
- **How:** Corporately as believers
- **Content:** Title, descriptors, quote from OT, application to today, entreaty for believers
- **Why:** Need for boldness to continue speaking the word of God

The pattern of prayer is seen again here where they start with a title, then a descriptor, and then the rest of the prayer.
The request is to proclaim the word of God, which the world will try to silence.

I love how they speak about Jesus: 

> "your holy servant Jesus"

This after referring to themselves as servants as well.

## Acts 6:4-6 | Devoting themselves to prayer and the ministry of the word

_4 But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word._
_5 And what they said pleased the whole gathering, and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit,_
_and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte of Antioch._
_6 These they set before the apostles, and they prayed and laid their hands on them._

The primary issue here was that the twelve were being involved in dealing with the issues of charity when they wanted to focus on the ministry of the word.
As they say in verse 2, "It is not right that we should give up preaching the word of God to serve tables."

However, in addressing the rest of the disciples, the twelve specifically said "we will devote ourselves to _prayer_ and to the _ministry of the word_". 

In other words, for them the ministry of the word goes hand-in-hand with prayer.
We can't devote ourselves to the ministry of the word without prayer.

## Acts 8:15-17 | Praying and laying on of hands

_14 Now when the apostles at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John,_
_15 who came down and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit,_
_16 for he had not yet fallen on any of them, but they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus._
_17 Then they laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit._

- **Beneficiaries:** New believers
- **Why:** For new believers to receive the Holy Spirit
- **How:** While or with laying on of hands

As Jesus laid His hands on the little children and blessed them, so the disciples are laying hands on the new believers and praying for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit.

## Acts 8:22-24 | Simon the magician

_22 Repent, therefore, of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord that, if possible, the intent of your heart may be forgiven you._
_23 For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity.”_
_24 And Simon answered, “Pray for me to the Lord, that nothing of what you have said may come upon me.”_

- **To whom:** The Lord
- **Beneficiary:** Simon the magician
- **Content:** Forgiveness
- **Why:** Seeking to buy the power to have people receive the Holy Spirit when he lays hands on them

Something that comes up as a regular theme in the Bible seems to be people who defer direct engagement with God, who rather want others to intercede on their behalf.
In this case, Simon is specifically told to pray to God, but he then asks Peter to pray on his behalf.

Interestingly, it seems that the prayer does not contain the repentance, but that the repentance should be made and then the prayer.
Possibly that repentance wasn't seen as something to confess to God, but something to undertake in our heart, and then go to God asking for forgiveness. 

## Acts 9:11 | Ananias should go to Paul

_11 And the Lord said to him, "Rise and got to the street called Straight,_
_and at the house of Judas look for a man of Tarsus named Saul, for behold, he is praying,_
_12 and he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him so that he might regain his sight."_

Nothing is said about this prayer, except that it happened.

What is precious to me is that God notices prayer.
God, who is all-knowing, mentions it, even though it wouldn't be strictly necessary for Ananias to know.

## Acts 9:40 | Peter called to pray for Tabitha

_40 But Peter put them all outside, and knelt down and prayed; and turning to the body he said, "Tabitha, arise."_

- **Beneficiaries**: Tabitha, but also those whom she served.
- **How**: Alone, and kneeling.
- **Why**: To restore to life a widow that blessed the church.

Peter, as a disciple of Christ, puts people out that he may pray alone to God.
He also kneels down, which is most likely what they picked up from Jesus.

Interestingly, this is the second time that someone approaches Peter that he may pray on their behalf (Simon the magician being the first).

## Acts 10:1-4 | Cornelius' CV

_1 At Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius, a centurion of what was known as the Italian Cohort,_
_2 a devout man who feared God with all his household, gave alms generously to the people, and prayed continually to God._
_3 About the ninth hour of the day he saw clearly in a vision an angel of God come in and say to him, “Cornelius.”_
_4 And he stared at him in terror and said, “What is it, Lord?”_
_And he said to him, “Your prayers and your alms have ascended as a memorial before God._

Cornelius was a devout man, which entailed three characteristics:

1. He feared God
2. He gave alms
3. He prayed continually

These are the descriptors that Luke chose.
Maybe it was the most prominent anyway, and not necessarily chosen to emphasize them over against other things, but it is still meaningful to see that these things are the things that would have resonated with the early church (and still with us today).

## Acts 10:9 | Peter went to the housetop to pray

_9 The next day, as they were on their journey and approaching the city, Peter went up on the housetop about the sixth hour to pray._

Interesting similarities between the stories of Cornelius and Peter:

1. Time of day specifically mentioned when the visions appeared to them both.
2. Prayer features in both of their stories.

Analysis:

- **How/manner:** On the rooftop.
- **When**: At noon (before lunch).

## Acts 10:30-31 | Cornelius praying when the angel appeared

_30 And Cornelius said, “Four days ago, about this hour, I was praying in my house at the ninth hour, and behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing_
_31 and said, ‘Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your alms have been remembered before God._

These verses confirm that Cornelius was also praying when he saw his vision, strengthening the tie between him and Peter.
God is manifesting Himself to them in the same way, because the dividing wall has been broken down.
When all peoples draw near to God, He shows mercy to them without making distinction.

## Acts 11:5 | Prayer mentioned in Peter's defense of his actions

_4 But Peter began and explained it to them in order:_
_5 “I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision, something like a great sheet descending, being let down from heaven by its four corners, and it came down to me._

Peter mentions the fact that he was praying as part of the apologetic.

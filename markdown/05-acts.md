# Acts

## Acts 1:14 Disciples pray with one accord

_14 All these with one accord were devoting themselves to prayer, together with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brothers._

We should also as groups _devote_ ourselves to prayer.

- **How**: Corporately as believers

## Acts 1:24-25 Disciples pray for replacement

_24 And they prayed and said, “You, Lord, who know the hearts of all, show which one of these two you have chosen_
_25 to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside to go to his own place.”_

This prayer seems to pick up two things from the life of Jesus:

1. Parenthetical descriptor: The disciples follow the example of Jesus in Matthew 11:25 where the prayer starts by addressing God and adding a descriptor.
   This also is the pattern taught in the Our Father prayer.
   However, naturally not a fixed rule, for example in the gospel of John Jesus would often add a statement of truth (rather than description) after addressing God.
2. Brevity: The disciples have naturally been praying a long while, as Jesus would have prayed through the night.
   But in this instance, the prayer is very short, as Jesus taught.

In this prayer as well, there is again 'statements of fact', such as "from which Judas turned aside to go to his own place".
In other words, knowing God is omniscient does not eradicate the natural conversational style that we would employ when speaking to one another, which does include giving context and describing situations.
However, there is never the sense that they are informing God, they just state what should already be known.

- **To whom**: The Lord.
  Difficult to know if Jesus was explicitly addressed, as Luke uses "Lord" regularly for both the Father and the Son.
- **Content**: Entreaty for guidance
- **Why**: To fulfill Scripture as it relates to the work of the ministry.

## Acts 2:42

_24 And they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers._

Again, prayer is brought up in the context of "devoting".
We need to devote ourselves to prayer.

- **How**: Corporately as believers

## Acts 3:1

_1 Now Peter and John were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour._

Part of devoting themselves to prayer seemed to be to go to 'prayer events', even in the systems (Temple) that were frequented by those who "killed the Author of life" (v. 15).
Furthermore, this temple was under the jurisdiction of the "council" (4:15), those who "crucified" (v. 10) and "rejected" (v. 11) Jesus.

Clearly Peter and John were able to operate within a place filled with unsanctified people, maybe especially because the purpose of that specific time was prayer.
It seems that their understanding that "you acted in ignorance" (v. 17) enabled them to be in their midst.

- **How**: Corporately, even in the presence of the ignorant

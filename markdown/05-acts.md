# Acts

## Acts 1:14 Disciples pray with one accord

_14 All these with one accord were devoting themselves to prayer, together with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brothers._

We should also as groups _devote_ ourselves to prayer.

- **How**: Corporately as believers

## Acts 1:24-25 Disciples pray for replacement

_24 And they prayed and said, “You, Lord, who know the hearts of all, show which one of these two you have chosen_
_25 to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside to go to his own place.”_

This prayer seems to pick up two things from the life of Jesus:

1. Parenthetical descriptor: The disciples follow the example of Jesus in Matthew 11:25 where the prayer starts by addressing God and adding a descriptor.
   This also is the pattern taught in the Our Father prayer.
   However, naturally not a fixed rule, for example in the gospel of John Jesus would often add a statement of truth (rather than description) after addressing God.
2. Brevity: The disciples have naturally been praying a long while, as Jesus would have prayed through the night.
   But in this instance, the prayer is very short, as Jesus taught.

In this prayer as well, there is again 'statements of fact', such as "from which Judas turned aside to go to his own place".
In other words, knowing God is omniscient does not eradicate the natural conversational style that we would employ when speaking to one another, which does include giving context and describing situations.
However, there is never the sense that they are informing God, they just state what should already be known.

- **To whom**: The Lord.
  Difficult to know if Jesus was explicitly addressed, as Luke uses "Lord" regularly for both the Father and the Son.
- **Content**: Entreaty for guidance
- **Why**: To fulfill Scripture as it relates to the work of the ministry.

## Acts 2:42

_24 And they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers._

Again, prayer is brought up in the context of "devoting".
We need to devote ourselves to prayer.

- **How**: Corporately as believers

## Acts 3:1

_1 Now Peter and John were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour._

Part of devoting themselves to prayer seemed to be to go to 'prayer events', even in the systems (Temple) that were frequented by those who "killed the Author of life" (v. 15).
Furthermore, this temple was under the jurisdiction of the "council" (4:15), those who "crucified" (v. 10) and "rejected" (v. 11) Jesus.

Clearly Peter and John were able to operate within a place filled with unsanctified people, maybe especially because the purpose of that specific time was prayer.
It seems that their understanding that "you acted in ignorance" (v. 17) enabled them to be in their midst.

- **How**: Corporately, even in the presence of the ignorant

## Acts 4:24-31

_23 When they were released, they went to their friends and reported what the chief priests and the elders had said to them._
_24 And when they heard it, they lifted their voices together to God and said,_
_“Sovereign Lord, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and everything in them,_
_25 who through the mouth of our father David, your servant, said by the Holy Spirit,_

_“‘Why did the Gentiles rage,_
    _and the peoples plot in vain?_
_26 The kings of the earth set themselves,_
    _and the rulers were gathered together,_
    _against the Lord and against his Anointed’ —_

_27 for truly in this city there were gathered together against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel,_
_28 to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place._
_29 And now, Lord, look upon their threats and grant to your servants to continue to speak your word with all boldness,_
_30 while you stretch out your hand to heal, and signs and wonders are performed through the name of your holy servant Jesus.”_
_31 And when they had prayed, the place in which they were gathered together was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and continued to speak the word of God with boldness._

- **To whom:** God the Father
- **How:** Corporately as believers
- **Content:** Title, descriptors, quote from OT, application to today, entreaty for believers
- **Why:** Need for boldness to continue speaking the word of God

The pattern of prayer is seen again here where they start with a title, then a descriptor, and then the rest of the prayer.
The request is to proclaim the word of God, which the world will try to silence.

I love how they speak about Jesus: 

> "your holy servant Jesus"

This after referring to themselves as servants as well.

## Acts 6:4-6

_4 But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word._
_5 And what they said pleased the whole gathering, and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit,_
_and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte of Antioch._
_6 These they set before the apostles, and they prayed and laid their hands on them._

The primary issue here was that the twelve were being involved in dealing with the issues of charity when they wanted to focus on the ministry of the word.
As they say in verse 2, "It is not right that we should give up preaching the word of God to serve tables."

However, in addressing the rest of the disciples, the twelve specifically said "we will devote ourselves to _prayer_ and to the _ministry of the word_". 

In other words, for them the ministry of the word goes hand-in-hand with prayer.
We can't devote ourselves to the ministry of the word without prayer.

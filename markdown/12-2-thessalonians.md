Paul here tells the Thessalonians:

1. What he wants God to grant them (that they be made worthy and that their resolve to do good would be fulfilled).
2. Why he wants God to grant that to them (that the name of Jesus would be glorified in them, and they in Him).
3. The means through which this would be possible ("his power" and "the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ").

That God may make us worthy and fulfill our every resolve for good and every work of faith.

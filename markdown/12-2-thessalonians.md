# 2 Thessalonians

## 2 Thessalonians 1:11-12 | May God fulfill your every resolve to do good

_11 To this end we always pray for you,_
_that our God may make you worthy of his calling and may fulfill every resolve for good and every work of faith by his power,_
_12 so that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in him,_
_according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ._

- **Beneficiaries:** Church in Thessalonica
- **Content:** Supplication
- **When:** Always
- **Why:** The glorification of the name of Jesus, and of the saints

Paul here tells the Thessalonians:

1. What he wants God to grant them (that they be made worthy and that their resolve to do good would be fulfilled).
2. Why he wants God to grant that to them (that the name of Jesus would be glorified in them, and they in Him).
3. The means through which this would be possible ("his power" and "the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ").

That God may make us worthy and fulfill our every resolve for good and every work of faith.

## 2 Thessalonians 3:1

_Finally, brothers, pray for us,_
_that the word of the Lord may speed ahead and be honored,_
_as happened among you,_
_2 and that we may be delivered from wicked and evil men._
_For not all have faith._

- **Beneficiaries:** Paul and his companions
- **Content:** Supplication
- **Why:** For the spreading of the word and for deliverance from wicked and evil men

As Paul did in Colossians 4:3, here he is again asking the congregation to pray for the effective sharing of the word of the Lord.
Here Paul adds deliverance, also something which he previously also linked to the prayer of a congregation (Philippians 1:19).

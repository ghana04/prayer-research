## 1 Peter 3:7 | That your prayers may not be hindered

_7 Likewise, husbands, live with your wives in an understanding way,_
_showing honor to the woman as the weaker vessel,_
_since they are heirs with you of the grace of life,_
_so that your prayers may not be hindered._

No analysis can be done on this, since prayer is not the subject but rather affected by the preceding instruction.
This does however indicate that our prayers are not offered through some channel that is unaffected by our lives, which builds on the same revelation found in the Old Testament.

## 1 Peter 3:12 | His ears are open to their prayer

_12 For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and his ears are open to their prayer._
_But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.‚Äù_

## Parable of the sower

Jesus provides the reality to his disciples that although the seed that is sowed is good, there will be different reactions. 

This is to avoid disappointment and doubt in the seed.
It's also to encourage the sowing, because even if only a few seeds fall on the good soil, the return from those seeds are at least 30 fold!

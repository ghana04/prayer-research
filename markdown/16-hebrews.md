## Hebrews 5:7 | In the days of His flesh

_7 In the days of his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications, with loud cries and tears, to him who was able to save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverence._

- **Beneficiaries:** Jesus (the one praying)
- **Content:** Supplication and intervention
- **Manner:** With loud cries and tears; with reverence
- **To whom:** The Father
- **Why:** For salvation

This passage is part of a section that focuses on Christ as our priest after the order of Melchizedek.
The prayers and supplications, the suffering that led to them, was all part of the process that led to Him being made perfect.

Surely it will be that way for us as well.

## Hebrews 13:18 | Pray for us

_18 Pray for us, for we are sure that we have a clear conscience, desiring to act honorably in all things._
_19 I urge you the more earnestly to do this in order that I may be restored to you the sooner._

- **Beneficiaries:** The writer to the Hebrews
- **Content:** Supplication
- **Why:** For the writer to be able to see these believers soon

Again, prayer is made to bring believers together.

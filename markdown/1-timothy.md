# 1 Timothy

## 1 Timothy 2:1-2 | Prayers for all people

_1 First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people,_
_2 for kings and all who are in high positions,_
_that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life,_
_godly and dignified in every way._

- **Beneficiaries:** All people, especially kings and those in high positions
- **Content:** Supplications, intercessions, and thanksgivings
- **Why:** That the Church may lead a peaceful and quiet life, and for salvation of unbelievers

The first thing that Paul wants Timothy to encourage in the believers is prayer.
Let us not encourage all other forms of things, if not prayer.

## 1 Timothy 2:8 | I desire that the men should pray

_8 I desire that in every place the men should pray, lifting holy hands, without anger or quarreling;_

- **Manner:** Lifting holy hands, without anger or quarreling
- **Where:** Every place where the believers gather

I see this as Paul encouraging the men to do what they would be tempted not to (pray, be peaceable), as he addresses a similar thing for women in the next verse.

## 1 Timothy 4:5 | Made holy by prayer

_Now the Spirit expressly says that in later times some will depart from the faith_
_by devoting themselves to deceitful spirits and teachings of demons,_
_2 through the insincerity of liars whose consciences are seared,_
_3 who forbid marriage and require abstinence from foods_
_that God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth._
_4 For everything created by God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving,_
_5 for it is made holy by the word of God and prayer._

- **Beneficiaries:** The things that the believer is to receive
- **Content:**
  - Guidance: That God would provide guidance.
  - Information: That God would answer a particular question.
  - Intervention: That God would act on behalf of someone.
  - Thanksgiving: Praising God.
  - Supplication: That God would grant something general.
- **Means:** The instrument/tool/method used to pray ("by what means").
  - E.g. "through Christ", or "using the Psalms"
- **Manner:** The manner in which prayer is conducted, whether style, attitude, or physical characteristic ("in what way").
  - E.g. "humbly", "kneeling", "earnestly"
- **To whom:** The one to whom the prayer is addressed, e.g. Father or Lord.
- **When:** The time aspect, such as "before dawn" or "after ministering to the crowds".
- **Where:** The location aspect.
- **Why:** The background/context for the prayer to occur.

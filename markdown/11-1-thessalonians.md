# 1 Thessalonians

## 1 Thessalonians 1:2-3 | Constantly mentioning you in our prayers

_2 We give thanks to God always for all of you,_
_constantly mentioning you in our prayers,_
_3 remembering before our God and Father your work of faith_
_and labor of love and steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ._

- **Beneficiaries:** Church in Thessalonica
- **Content:** Thanksgiving and supplication (probably)
- **Manner:** With remembrance and thanksgiving
- **To whom:** God
- **When:** Constantly

Again, Paul makes a point to mention to the group that he is praying for them unceasingly.
This is probably meant as encouragement and a form of discipleship, not only showing them the importance of prayer but also the content.

It seems that part of the 'fuel' for Paul's prayer is the good deeds and steadfast hope of other believers; it informs his thanksgiving.
It is as if he praying in the same vein as Psalm 20:3, which says:

> May he remember all your offerings
> and regard with favor all your burnt sacrifices!

## 1 Thessalonians 3:9-10 | We pray most earnestly night and day

_9 For what thanksgiving can we return to God for you,_
_for all the joy that we feel for your sake before our God,_
_10 as we pray most earnestly night and day_
_that we may see you face to face and supply what is lacking in your faith?_

- **Beneficiaries:** Church in Thessalonica (indirectly)
- **Content:** Supplication
- **Manner:** Most earnestly
- **To whom:** God
- **When:** Night and day
- **Why:** That Paul and his companions may see the Thessalonians in person and minister to them

Again, Paul shares with the Thessalonians how they make him feel, and how it causes him to pray.
A recurring theme in Paul is also that he may meet the churches that he knows in person.

Tying in to James, which speaks about fervent prayer, Paul's prayer also seemed to have an urgency ("earnestly").
Prayer was not a formality for Paul, he truly believed in the power of prayer.

## 1 Thessalonians 5:16-18 | Pray without ceasing

_16 Rejoice always,_
_17 pray without ceasing,_
_18 give thanks in all circumstances;_
_for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you._

- **When:** Without ceasing
- **Why:** It is God's will for believers

After telling the Thessalonians that he prays for them "constantly" and "night and day", Paul now admonishes them to pray without ceasing.
It seems here that Paul is emphasizing three constants for believers:

1. Rejoicing
2. Prayer
3. Thanksgiving

This is an instruction for believers, and part of the consistency in our lives should be prayer.

## 1 Thessalonians 5:25 | Brothers, pray for us

_25 Brothers, pray for us._

- **Beneficiaries:** Paul and his companions
- **Content:** Supplication (general)

This is a general exhortation, but it seems to be the only thing that Paul asks of the congregations (except for gifts for other congregations).

# 3 John 2

_2 Beloved, I pray that all may go well with you and that you may be in good health, as it goes well with your soul._

- **Beneficiaries:** Gaius, a brother
- **Content:** Supplication for Gaius' health
- **Why:** For the well being of the brother Gaius.

Prayers for general and physical well being are Biblical.
The greater joy, however, lies in the well being of the soul.

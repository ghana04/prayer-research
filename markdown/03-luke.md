# Luke

## Luke 1:10 | Multitude praying at the hour of incense

*And the whole multitude of the people where praying at the hour of incense.*

Just such a beautiful picture of prayer arising at the same time as incense, and that in this context the Lord reveals His plan to His servant Zechariah.

Later also, Gabriel tells him "your prayer has been heard".
This is also such a strong theme in the Psalms, where the Lord is entreated to 'listen', 'incline His ear', and 'hear'.
The determining factor for something happening from our prayers is that God hears them.
In a sense God hears all prayers, but in a Biblical framework God 'hearing' means God is giving attention to it by acting.

Here a prayer that Zechariah must have prayed for decades is heard, which means it will now come to pass.

## Luke 2:37 | Prophetess Anna

*... She did not depart from the temple, worshiping with fasting and prayer night and day.*

Not many people are mentioned in the Bible by name, but this worshiper, the one who worships with fasting and prayer night and day, she is mentioned by name. 
God knows the name, knows the person, who worships Him by prayer and fasting, night and day.

The outflow of meeting Christ was to (1) give thanks to God and (2) to speak of Him _to all who were waiting for the redemption of Jerusalem_.
She didn't minister Christ to arbitrary crowds, but to those who whose hearts were inclined to the things of God.

## Luke 3:21 | Jesus praying after His baptism

*Now when all the people were baptized, and when Jesus also had been baptized and was praying, the heavens were opened,*

Jesus the received the Holy Spirit as He was praying, His life seemed filled with prayer.

> Maybe the rest of the study will include more ties to the presence of the Holy Spirit and prayer?

## Luke 5:15-16 | Withdrawing amid great crowds

*15 But now even more the report about him went abroad, and great crowds gathered to hear him and to be healed of their infirmities.*
*16 But he would withdraw to desolate places and pray.*

- **Where**: Desolate place

The increased demand in ministry did not change the practice Jesus had to withdraw and pray.
In fact, it seems that it might have increased it.

## Luke 5:33 | The disciples of John fast often and offer prayers

*And they said to him, "The disciples of Johns fast often and offer prayers, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink."*

Nothing really gleaned about prayer, except that it goes hand in hand with fasting.
The reply of Jesus seems to insinuate that, as He only mentions "fasting" without adding prayer.
Most likely this is because the one implied that the other will happen. 

Jesus determines appropriateness of a certain way of living, not us.

## Luke 6:12 | All night prayer on mountain

*In these days he went out to the mountain to pray, and all night he continued in prayer to God.*

- **Where**: On a mountain.

Jesus seemed to have two favorite places to pray:

1. A desolate place.
2. A mountain.

Both provided solitude, but mountains seem to be places in the Bible where God really meets with His people.

## Luke 6:28 | Pray for those who abuse you

*27 But I say to you who hear, Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,*
*28 bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you.*

- **Beneficiaries**: Your enemies

## Luke 9:18 | He was praying alone

*Now it happened that as he was praying alone, the disciples were with him.*
*And he asked them, "Who do the crowds say that I am?"*

- **Where**: Alone

He would pray alone even as the disciples were with him.

## Luke 9:28-29 | Praying and then transfigured

*28 Now about eight days after these sayings he took with him Peter and John and James and went up on the mountain to pray.*
*29 And as he was praying, the appearance of his face was altered, and his clothing became dazzling white.*

- **Where**: On a mountain.

Jesus seemed to take the 'inner circle' with him when He went praying.
It seems that He would leave them at the location and go a little further on to pray on His own (as at Gethsemane).

As Moses' face shone after spending time with God on the mountain, so now Jesus' face is shining as He was communing with the Father in prayer.

## Luke 10:2 | Praying for the harvest

Parallel to Matthew 9:38.



Parallel to Matthew 11:25-27.

## Luke 11:1-2 | Praying before teaching the Our Father

*Now Jesus was praying in a certain place, and when He finished, one of his disciples said to him, "Lord, teach us to pray, as John taught his disciples."*
*2 And he said to them, "When you pray, say: ..."*

- **Where**: Somewhere alone, but within eyesight

It seems that when Jesus was praying, the disciples would know it as they would be able to see it. 
When He finished praying, it would be visible to them, and they would then approach Him.

## Luke 18:1-8 | A parable to encourage prayer

*1 And he told them a parable to the effect that they ought always to pray and not lose heart.*
*2 He said, “In a certain city there was a judge who neither feared God nor respected man.*
*3 And there was a widow in that city who kept coming to him and saying, ‘Give me justice against my adversary.’*
*4 For a while he refused, but afterward he said to himself, ‘Though I neither fear God nor respect man,*
*5 yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will give her justice, so that she will not beat me down by her continual coming.’”*
*6 And the Lord said, “Hear what the unrighteous judge says.*
*7 And will not God give justice to his elect, who cry to him day and night?*
*Will he delay long over them?*
*8 I tell you, he will give justice to them speedily.*
*Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?”*

- **When**: Always.
- **How**: With faith.

Jesus makes a strong link here between faith and prayer.
When He comes, will He find the kind of faith that will motivate people to pray?
The faith that believes that God will grant justice to His elect?

"who cry to him day and night" calls to mind the example of the widow Anna in Luke 2:37, who prayed 'night and day'.

Those who draw near must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of those who seek him.
Surely this includes prayer, we must draw near to God knowing that He hears and that He is able to answer our prayers.
Above it all, that there is a sure reward for those who pray, since they are in a way seeking Him. 

## Luke 18:10-11 | Pride can manifest in prayer

*10 “Two men went up into the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.*
*11 The Pharisee, standing by himself, prayed thus:*
*‘God, I thank you that I am not like other men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector.*
*12 I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I get.’*
*13 But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying,*
*‘God, be merciful to me, a sinner!’*
*14 I tell you, this man went down to his house justified, rather than the other.*
*For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.”*

- **How**: With humility.
- **Beneficiary**: The person praying.

Prayer can easily be incorporated in all manner of sinful ways.
Jesus already addressed those who for pretense make long prayers, seeking to put their 'goodness' on display.
In this case, the Pharisee 'thanks God' for not being a sinful man. 

Thanking God is a good thing, as a host of verses will attest to.
Even here, however, the sinful heart can skillfully exalt itself.

Maybe in our day it might be less brazen to avoid being too closely identifiable with this parable, but the temptation is still there.
We should guard against manifesting our pride through our prayers.
Rather, we should seek in prayer to humble ourselves before God Almighty, and in doing so He will exalt us.

## Luke 19:45-46 | My house shall be called a house of prayer

*45 And he entered the temple and began to drive out those who sold,*
*46 saying to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be a house of prayer,' but you have made it a den of robbers."*

A defining characteristic of the house of God is that it would be a place where prayer is made.

From the scripture quoted by Jesus (Isaiah 56:7):

*6 "And the foreigners who join themselves to the LORD,*
*to minister to him, to love the name of the LORD, and to be his servants,*
*everyone who keeps the Sabbath and does not profane it,*
*and holds fast my covenant --*
*7 these I will bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer;*
*their burnt offerings and their sacrifices will be accepted on my altar;*
*for my house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples.*

Wow!
In the original text, the sense isn't 'a house where we pray for the gentiles', but rather, 'a house where the gentiles, who have joined themselves to God, can come and pray'. 
This is amazing!
It makes God the focus, while at the same time showing His benevolence toward men. 

The house of God, a place of prayer, is a place where the gentiles are called to *for the purpose of offering prayer*, of bringing their (living) sacrifices.

The activity of buying and selling, something supposedly given to aid the worship of God, actually started to subvert the purpose for which the house was created in the first place.
Jesus drove out the pragmatists who turned His house into something it should not be.

## Luke 20:47 | For pretense make long prayers

Parallel of Mark 12:40.

## Luke 21:36 | Stay awake with prayer before the second coming

*But stay awake at all times, praying that you may have strength to escape all these things that are going to take place, and to stand before the Son of Man."*

- **When**: At all times
- **Why**: For strength to endure trials, and to be able to stand before the Son of Man
- **Beneficiary**: The ones praying

The implications here are that of ourselves we don't have the strength to escape all these things, and that of ourselves we can't stand before the Son of Man. 

Prayer assumes we are insufficient of ourselves.
Prayer assumes we need outside help.
Prayer assumes faith, both to believe what Jesus said and to find grace for the times which he predicted.


## Luke 22:31-32 | Prayer for Peter's faith

*31 Simon, Simon, behold, Satan demanded to have you, that he might sift you like wheat,*
*32 But I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail.*
*And when you have returned again, strengthen your brothers.*

- **Beneficiary**: Peter

Peter doesn't know what trials he will go through.
Through his lack of knowledge of the future, he could not pray for himself or would not have known the need to do so with earnestness.

Jesus, our great High Priest, who intercedes on our behalf, here prays for Peter.
He knew what Peter would face and that Peter needed help.
This prayer delivers Peter.

## Luke 22:40-46 | Prayer in Gethsemane

*39 And he came out and went, as was his custom, to the Mount of Olives, and the disciples followed him.*
*40 And when he came to the place, he said to them, “Pray that you may not enter into temptation.”*
*41 And he withdrew from them about a stone's throw, and knelt down and prayed,*
*42 saying, “Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me.*
*Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done.”*
*43 And there appeared to him an angel from heaven, strengthening him.*
*44 And being in agony he prayed more earnestly; and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to the ground.*
*45 And when he rose from prayer, he came to the disciples and found them sleeping for sorrow,*
*46 and he said to them, “Why are you sleeping? Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation.”*

- **Where**: Mount of Olives, stone throw away from disciples
- **How**: Kneeling down
- **What**: Deliverance if possible, but ultimately the will of the Father

After Jesus prayed, He was strengthened _by an angel_.
Again, God accomplishing his work through intermediaries.

Even after the strengthening, His soul was still in agony.
However, this agony drove Him to pray _more earnestly_.

The answer to increased tribulation was increased prayer.

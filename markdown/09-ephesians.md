# Ephesians

## Ephesians 1:16

_16 I do not cease to give thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers,_
_17 that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory,_
_may give you the Spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of him,_
_18 having the eyes of your hearts enlightened,_
_that you may know what is the hope to which he has called you,_
_what are the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints,_
_19 and what is the immeasurable greatness of his power toward us who believe,_
_according to the working of his great might_
_20 that he worked in Christ when he raised him from the dead_
_and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places,_

- **Beneficiaries:** Ephesian church
- **Content:** Supplication
- **Manner:** With thanksgiving
- **To whom:** The God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory
- **When:** Regularly
- **Why:** For the Spirit to be given to the Ephesians

Paul's prayer has the following intended request: that the Ephesians may be filled with the Spirit.
Paul calls the Spirit the "Spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of him", which ties in well with the outcome of this filling:

- Knowing what is the hope to which God has called us.
- What are the riches of His glorious inheritance.
- What is the immeasurable greatness of His power toward us who believe.

Again, there is a strong trinitarian aspect to this prayer.

## Ephesians 6:18

_17 and take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God,_
_18 praying at all times in the Spirit, with all prayer and supplication._
_To that end, keep alert with all perseverance, making supplication for all the saints,_
_19 and also for me, that words may be given to me in opening my mouth boldly to proclaim the mystery of the gospel,_

- **Beneficiaries:** Those praying themselves (Ephesian church) and all the saints
- **Content:** Supplication
- **Manner:** In the Spirit
- **When:** All times
- **Why:** Generally for the church in Ephesus, and for Paul to boldly proclaim the mystery of the gospel

In Ephesians, prayer is done both _in_ the Spirit, but also _for_ more of the Spirit.

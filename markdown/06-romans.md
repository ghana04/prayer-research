## Romans 1:8-10 | Paul praying through Jesus

_8 First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is proclaimed in all the world._
_9 For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I mention you_
_10 always in my prayers, asking that somehow by God's will I may now at last succeed in coming to you._

- **Beneficiaries:** Probably the church in Rome.
- **Content:** Thanksgiving and asking God to make a way that Paul may come to the church in Rome.
- **How:** Through Jesus Christ.
- **Manner:** Without ceasing.
- **To whom:** God (the Father).
- **When:** Always.
- **Why:** Thanksgiving is rooted in the church's faith, and the ask is with the end in mind to impart a spiritual gift (1:11) and to reap a spiritual harvest (1:13).

Paul thanks God through Jesus Christ.
Wow, that our prayers would consciously be through Jesus Christ, which is the only way to the Father.

Paul is also not shy to say to the church in a public letter that he prays for them without ceasing, and what the content and the intended result of his prayer is.
This is interesting because Jesus taught the private life of prayer, yet He also would pray in front of people and tell Peter that He prayed for him.

First thing gleaned from this is to consciously pray through Jesus Christ, even though it's obviously not required to say "through Christ" or "in Jesus' name" when we pray, which is made clear by the Our Father.
Yet we are not to see ourselves as approaching God the Father by any other means than the work and person of His Son.
Jesus is still the way to the Father, whether foreshadowed in the Old Testament by sacrifice and righteous living by faith, or in the New Testament as the risen High Priest whose body is the veil that was torn for us to enter the throne room of grace.

## Romans 8:26 | The Spirit helps us in our weakness

_26 Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness._
_For we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words._

- **How:** By the Spirit

As Jesus continually lives to make intercession for us, so also the Spirit intercedes for us.

Taking this passage together with the previous one, we can say that we pray _through Jesus Christ_ and _with or by the Spirit_. 

This is so profound.
By the Spirit we groan for our adoption (v. 23), but the Spirit also helps us in our weakness.
What is this weakness?
It is that we do not know what to pray for.
But "the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God" (v. 27).

## Romans 10:1 | That they may be saved

_1 Brothers, my heart's desire and my prayer to God for them is that they may be saved._

- **Beneficiaries:** Ethnic Israel.
- **Manner:** In alignment with the desire of the heart.
- **To whom:** God.
- **Why:** Paul loves his fellow Jews and desires that they become saved.

Paul here is praying for a distinct group of people, categorized along ethnic lines.
It also happens to be the group that he belongs to, and because of his great love for them he asks God for their salvation.

It is noteworthy also that Paul's prayer was an outflow of the desire of his heart, not a generic platitude that he prayed because he felt it was appropriate.

# Miscellaneous reflections

## Prayers on the cross

There is so much richness and depth in the example of Christ both before and during His crucifixion.

The prayers on the cross provide a great framework of how we can also pray during times of persecution and suffering.

1. Forgiveness for our enemies.
2. Godly/scriptural lamentation.
3. Trust in God.

Maybe it is only after we have prayed 1 and 2 that we will be able to have processed the emotions of heart and prepared ourself for 3.

## Reflections on Colossians 1:9

It seems to me that the natural expected fruit of growing maturity in Christ is thanksgiving and joy, both of which are not grounded in the things that pass away, but in that which is to come (eternal).
We all desire to be in a state of joy, but the only means we can access it in our natural state is through favorable circumstances and physical pleasures (food, sex, alcohol), both of which affect our emotions.

It is necessary to be careful here because the Bible doesn't make joy the entry point to the gospel or a reason for proclaiming it.
However, for those who are saved, Paul clearly wants them to be joyful and thankful.
It's just that he wants them to be joyful and thankful for the right reasons.

The prosperity gospel is in contradicting Paul on this point, since it uses the means of the natural man (favorable circumstances and physical pleasures) to get people to a state of joy.
In stead of putting people's minds on the things above, it puts it on the things below.

The words "endurance" and "patience" assumes unfavorable circumstances for the natural man, but the word "joy" assumes favorable circumstances for the spiritual man.
Probably what James had in mind when he wrote "count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trails of various kinds".

## Reflections on 1 Thessalonians 5:16-18

_16 Rejoice always,_
_17 pray without ceasing,_
_18 give thanks in all circumstances;_
_for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you._

Paul is teaching what he is practicing.

This is evident from the close parallel with 1 Thessalonians 3:9-10:

- _For what thanksgiving can we return to God for you,_ (give thanks in all circumstances)
- _for all the joy that we feel for your sake before our God,_ (rejoice always)
- _10 as we pray most earnestly night and day_ (pray without ceasing)

If asking for God's will for a specific matter in our life is like asking which window to use in a house, then obeying this passage (and others such as 1 Thessalonians 4:3) is like the foundation.
We can't be thinking too much about the window if the foundation isn't laid.

Let us first ensure we get this 'basic' in place and have it solidified, before we move on to other things.
This establishes the supremacy of God's will above our own, and will surely better prepare us for discerning more secondary things.

Even in a workplace, a manager will refrain from giving people instructions for a task if they are not executing sufficiently on the instructions for a prior task.

## Reflections on 1 Tim 4:5

_5 for it is made holy by the word of God and prayer._

It seems here that Paul says that created things are in some way elevated ("made holy") by prayer.

From [Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible commentary](https://biblehub.com/commentaries/1_timothy/4-5.htm) 

> '"by means of intercessory prayer" (so the Greek)—that is, consecratory prayer in behalf of "the creature" or food'

Although the eucharist is the supreme example of our food taking on a different quality, every other meal can in a lesser way likewise seem to have that effect.

> "Just as in the Lord's Supper, the thanksgiving prayer sanctifies the elements, separating them from their naturally alien position in relation to the spiritual world, and transferring them to their true relation to the new life.
> So in every use of the creature, thanksgiving prayer has the same effect, and ought always to be used (1Co 10:30, 31)."

How wonderful is that!

The inclusion of the phrase, "the word of God", according to most commentaries, either mean:

1. That the word of God is used in the prayer, for example phrases built using scripture.
2. That the prayer rests on the foundation of the word of God, which declares all foods to be clean and a gift from God.

In my view, both can be held to without making too much about it, since both are good general principles to follow.

From conversation with Stephan:

- In the past, food was made appropriate (sanctified/made holy) to be eaten by the priests in the Levitical system (old covenant).
- It would make sense that for the new covenant priesthood of believers, food would also be 'set apart'.
- This happens, however, not by the food itself or the handling thereof, but by a spiritual act: thanksgiving.
- This thanksgiving is based on the word of God and would benefit from using its language.

Other scriptures that have implications on the act of thanksgiving:

- **Psalm 145:15-16** | The eyes of all look to you, and you give them their food in due season.
  You open your hand; you satisfy the desire of every living thing.
- **Matthew 14:19** | Then he ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass, and taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and said a blessing.
  Then he broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.
- **Matthew 15:36** | he took the seven loaves and the fish, and having given thanks he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.
- **Luke 22:17-19** | 17 And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he said, “Take this, and divide it among yourselves.
  18 For I tell you that from now on I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.”
  19 And he took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to them, saying, “This is my body, which is given for you.
  Do this in remembrance of me.”
- **Acts 10:15** | And the voice came to him again a second time, “What God has made clean, do not call common.”
- **Acts 27:35** | And when he had said these things, he took bread, and giving thanks to God in the presence of all he broke it and began to eat.
- **1 Cor 10:30** | If I partake with thankfulness, why am I denounced because of that for which I give thanks?

## Reflections on 1 Cor 10:27-33

**1 Cor 10:27-33**

_27 If one of the unbelievers invites you to dinner and you are disposed to go,_
_eat whatever is set before you without raising any question on the ground of conscience._
_28 But if someone says to you, “This has been offered in sacrifice,” then do not eat it,_
_for the sake of the one who informed you, and for the sake of conscience—_
_29 I do not mean your conscience, but his._
_For why should my liberty be determined by someone else's conscience?_
_30 If I partake with thankfulness, why am I denounced because of that for which I give thanks?_
_31 So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God._
_32 Give no offense to Jews or to Greeks or to the church of God,_
_33 just as I try to please everyone in everything I do,_
_not seeking my own advantage, but that of many, that they may be saved._

The difficulty in this passage is verse 29.
As [Barnes](https://biblehub.com/commentaries/1_corinthians/10-29.htm) puts it:

> "There is much difficulty in this clause; for as it now stands, it seems to be entirely contradictory to what the apostle had been saying."

Seems like it's either an objection that is being quoted as if from a Corinthian church member:

> "why should my liberty be determined by someone else's conscience?
> If I partake with thankfulness, why am I denounced because of that for which I give thanks?"

It's likely either that or Paul is saying something along lines of "Unless my conscience bears witness to me that I shouldn't, I will partake of that which is set before me.
I won't try and gauge every single person's conscience who is at the table in an over-the-top way, where (having considered them all already) I (for example) ask them 'does this affect your conscience?'."

As Barnes further states, quoting a paraphrase from Doddridge:

> "I speak only of acts obvious to human observation: for as to what immediately lies between God and my own soul, why is my liberty to be judged, arraigned, condemned at the bar of another man's conscience?"

In other words, Paul is explaining why he can eat the meat offered to idols in verse 27, even if the unbeliever might have a conscience issue.
However, when it is made known ("obvious to human observation"), then use your freedom to abstain.

## Reflections on suffering from Hebrews 5:8 and Romans 5:3-5

Why is there suffering in the life of a believer?

Suffering is a unique instrument in the hand of God, used to produce two things from these passages:

1. Learning environment for obedience
2. Endurance (which in turn produces character, which in turn produces hope)

Suffering is where we learn obedience.
In stead of just wishing it away, we should seek answer "what does obedience look like in this time?".

At least according to James 5:13, and the example of Jesus in Gethsemane, it should be a time of prayer.

## Reflections on James 5:14-16

_14 Is anyone among you sick?_
_Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord._
_15 And the prayer of faith will save the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up._
_And if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven._
_16 Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, that you may be healed._
_The prayer of a righteous person has great power as it is working._

We are instructed to pray for people that the Lord might raise them up.
In this way we re-enact the pattern of death followed by resurrection, which is the Lord's doing.
This re-enactment brings glory to God by being a witness to Christ.

So how does praying and confessing contribute to this, or why does God require it as part of this work of resurrection?
Maybe confession is part of it because that which God wants to resurrect must be blameless.
If we confess our sins, God is faithful to cleanse us.
That which is cleansed is proper to be resurrected, that which is filthy should die.

Prayer is probably required because of the implicit way it puts trust in God rather than the works of man.
Jesus prayed to the Father before His resurrection, on multiple times, the last one being the commending of His spirit into the Father's hands.

As with Christ, we might be in situations where salvation or deliverance is possible by our own hands, just like He was able to call upon angels and end the entire mock trial.
Yet if we spent time with the Father, we could discern that He intends for us to drink the cup, not work our way out of it.
This will point to our faith in Him, that we entrust Him to raise us up and deliver us rather than seeking to deliver ourselves.

However, it's not always like this, and we must discern.
Jesus also escaped the hands of those who wanted to throw Him off the cliff, because His time has not yet come.
In many situations, He got out of trials by reasoning from the scriptures.
Like Paul, we might have to climb in a basket so that our friends can let us down the wall to safety, rather than waiting on God to change the situation supernaturally.

God is going to bring us to places where we will die.
It will be uncomfortable, and we'll wish to avoid it.
But in that place there will be the opportunity for resurrection, for our benefit and to the glory of God.
This will prepare us for the final death and resurrection, where we'll have good confidence and faith in God that he'll raise us again as He has been faithful to do many times before.

## Reflections on 1 Peter 3:7

_7 Likewise, husbands, live with your wives in an understanding way,_
_showing honor to the woman as the weaker vessel,_
_since they are heirs with you of the grace of life,_
_so that your prayers may not be hindered._

Our prayers are not offered through some channel that is unaffected by our lives.
Whether or not our prayers are heard are determined by more than just directing them at the true God.
It is determined more than by just our sincere intent to communicate to God.
It is determined by our obedience as well.

This builds on the same revelation found in the Old Testament.

Here are a few verses:

_44 “**If** your people go out to battle against their enemy,_
_by **whatever way you shall send** them,_
_**and** they pray to the Lord **toward the city that you have chosen** and the house that I have built for your name,_
_45 **then** hear in heaven their prayer and their plea, and maintain their cause._

~ 1 Kings 8:44-45

_48 if they repent with all their heart and with all their soul_
_in the land of their enemies, who carried them captive,_
_and pray to you toward their land, which you gave to their fathers,_
_the city that you have chosen, and the house that I have built for your name,_
_49 then hear in heaven your dwelling place their prayer and their plea, and maintain their cause_

~ 1 Kings 8:48-49

_5 “Turn back, and say to Hezekiah the leader of my people,_
_Thus says the Lord, the God of David your father:_
_I have heard your prayer; I have seen your tears._
_Behold, I will heal you._
_On the third day you shall go up to the house of the Lord,_

~ 2 Kings 20:5

_he regards the prayer of the destitute and does not despise their prayer._

~ Psalm 102:17

_When he is tried, let him come forth guilty; let his prayer be counted as sin!_

~ Psalm 109:7

_Let my prayer be counted as incense before you, and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice!_

~ Psalm 141:2

_The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord, but the prayer of the upright is acceptable to him._

~ Proverbs 15:8

_The Lord is far from the wicked, but he hears the prayer of the righteous._

~ Proverbs 15:29

_If one turns away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer is an abomination._

~ Proverbs 28:9

_When you spread out your hands,_
_I will hide my eyes from you;_
_even though you make many prayers, I will not listen;_
_your hands are full of blood._

~ Isaiah 1:15

_14 **if** my people who are called by my name **humble themselves**,_
_**and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways**,_
_**then I will hear** from heaven and will forgive their sin and heal their land._

~ 2 Chronicles 7:14

_12 And when he was in distress, he entreated the favor of the Lord his God_
_**and humbled himself greatly** before the God of his fathers._
_13 He prayed to him, and **God was moved by his entreaty** and heard his plea and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom._
_Then Manasseh knew that the Lord was God._

~ 2 Chronicles 33:12-13

When someone is praying for forgiveness, there seems to be less 'conditions'.
However, the instances specifically mentioning that God heard and that He was moved are those where the repentance went together with sincere weeping and/or humbling.

In general though, it's the effective, fervent prayer of the **righteous** that avails much.
There are surely thousands of prayers made that are an abomination to God, probably much more than those that He accepts as pleasing incense.

## Reflections on 1 Peter

Peter assumes prayer, his letter doesn't teach on the topic itself but it is of great concern for him that prayers do happen and that any impediments are removed.

In the three instances where prayer is mentioned:

1. Exhortation for husbands to live with their wives in an understanding way, so that their prayers would not be hindered.
2. Exhortation for the church to live in a godly way since God hears the prayers of the righteous (amongst other reasons).
3. Exhortation for the church to live in self-controlled way for the sake of their prayers.

## Reflections on ## 1 John 5:16

_16 If anyone sees his brother committing a sin not leading to death, he shall ask, and God will give him life—_
_to those who commit sins that do not lead to death._
_There is sin that leads to death; I do not say that one should pray for that._

This verse sets out a clear precedent of someone who is not sinning praying for someone who is.
Not that the one praying would be without sin, but that in this case he is not the transgressor.

Very interesting as well is that the answer to the prayer for sin is life.
Why life?

For God to 'fix' something the answer isn't to remove what is wrong, but to replace what is wrong with what is right.
Take examples from the rest of scripture:

1. Although the world is under the curse of sin, God will replace it with a new world.
2. Our sin-affected bodies will be replaced with glorified bodies.
3. When the first Adam sinned, God raised up a succession of Adams to replace him, culminating in the final Adam.
4. When Jesus was healing people, He wouldn't remove that which was sick or dead, but rather restored it to its original function.

Therefore the work of God in our lives is not just removing, but replacing.
He removes our selfishness and replaces it with concern for others.
He removes our pride and replaces it with humility.
He removes our fruitless branches so that more fruit might be brought forth.

Yet, there are cases where God does cast away, which is in itself a death sentence.
He casts the unrepentant sinner into hell.
Hell is essentially a place where the life-giving and regenerative power of God is not operating.
That which is decaying keeps on decaying.
That which dries up keep ons drying up.
There is no life that rejuvenates or redeems.

For Christ then to be the life means that all God's restorative and redemptive actions happen through Christ.
Where this world is lifeless and decaying because of sin, the presence of Christ brings life.
Because Christ is eternal, He is able to eternally sustain those who are in Him.
Now it is seen partially, but when Christ returns in His glory it will be full and complete.

As a culture we are much more conditioned on the 'throw something away' mentality, which is not an accurate reflection of God.
For God to throw something away is the most severe form of judgement, it's the final death, to be separated from Him.
And as far as I can see in the scripture, God is not hasty to do this.
He waits for the sins of the Amorites to be complete before casting them out.
He doesn't immediately kill Adam and Eve.
He doesn't immediately destroy Cain.
He doesn't discard the human race after we fell into sin.
He didn't write off the Israelites despite their many sinful rebellions.

Maybe there is a Biblical case to be made for restoring things, showing patience with what is broken, in stead of just casting everything away that breaks.
We can use the 'life' that we can give to in turn give life to that which we come in contact with.
A challenge we have is that much of what is produced today is produced with 'dispensable' in mind, for our convenience.
But God was greatly 'inconvenienced' in sending His Son to restore fallen humanity.

Maybe what we need to witness to the world today is at least the attempt to restore that which is broken.
If that fails (like the unrepentant sinner), then we cast it away.
Until then, we attempt to bring life to bear on the object/thing/person.

## Reflections on John 11:4

God wants to give us glory, as Jesus also affirms in John 17:22.
However, he wants to give that glory to as in a certain capacity and where His name will be hallowed.

We will receive glory _as_:

- A servant of God
- A son of God
- A disciple of Christ

It is like a master sending a servant to a foreign nation.
If that servant is clothed in rags, people will assume a cruel or poor or negligent master.

Naturally, the master would want the servant to be well dressed and esteemed, as it brings glory to him.
However, if the receiving of this glory jeopardizes the mission for which the servant was sent, then the master would be wise to remove that glory to keep the servant focused on the mission.
As with Abraham, he could entrust his servant with many riches to accomplish the mission.
As with Elisha, he could not entrust his servant with many riches, as Gehazi had a greedy heart.

## Prayers on the cross

There is so much richness and depth in the example of Christ both before and during His crucifixion.

The prayers on the cross provide a great framework of how we can also pray during times of persecution and suffering.

1. Forgiveness for our enemies.
2. Godly/scriptural lamentation.
3. Trust in God.

Maybe it is only after we have prayed 1 and 2 that we will be able to have processed the emotions of heart and prepared ourself for 3.

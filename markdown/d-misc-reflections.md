# Miscellaneous reflections

## Prayers on the cross

There is so much richness and depth in the example of Christ both before and during His crucifixion.

The prayers on the cross provide a great framework of how we can also pray during times of persecution and suffering.

1. Forgiveness for our enemies.
2. Godly/scriptural lamentation.
3. Trust in God.

Maybe it is only after we have prayed 1 and 2 that we will be able to have processed the emotions of heart and prepared ourself for 3.

## Reflections on Colossians 1:9

It seems to me that the natural expected fruit of growing maturity in Christ is thanksgiving and joy, both of which are not grounded in the things that pass away, but in that which is to come (eternal).
We all desire to be in a state of joy, but the only means we can access it in our natural state is through favorable circumstances and physical pleasures (food, sex, alcohol), both of which affect our emotions.

It is necessary to be careful here because the Bible doesn't make joy the entry point to the gospel or a reason for proclaiming it.
However, for those who are saved, Paul clearly wants them to be joyful and thankful.
It's just that he wants them to be joyful and thankful for the right reasons.

The prosperity gospel is in contradicting Paul on this point, since it uses the means of the natural man (favorable circumstances and physical pleasures) to get people to a state of joy.
In stead of putting people's minds on the things above, it puts it on the things below.

The words "endurance" and "patience" assumes unfavorable circumstances for the natural man, but the word "joy" assumes favorable circumstances for the spiritual man.
Probably what James had in mind when he wrote "count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trails of various kinds".

## Reflections on 1 Thessalonians 5:16-18

_16 Rejoice always,_
_17 pray without ceasing,_
_18 give thanks in all circumstances;_
_for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you._

Paul is teaching what he is practicing.

This is evident from the close parallel with 1 Thessalonians 3:9-10:

- _For what thanksgiving can we return to God for you,_ (give thanks in all circumstances)
- _for all the joy that we feel for your sake before our God,_ (rejoice always)
- _10 as we pray most earnestly night and day_ (pray without ceasing)

If asking for God's will for a specific matter in our life is like asking which window to use in a house, then obeying this passage (and others such as 1 Thessalonians 4:3) is like the foundation.
We can't be thinking too much about the window if the foundation isn't laid.

Let us first ensure we get this 'basic' in place and have it solidified, before we move on to other things.
This establishes the supremacy of God's will above our own, and will surely better prepare us for discerning more secondary things.

Even in a workplace, a manager will refrain from giving people instructions for a task if they are not executing sufficiently on the instructions for a prior task.

## Reflections on 1 Tim 4:5

_5 for it is made holy by the word of God and prayer._

It seems here that Paul says that created things are in some way elevated ("made holy") by prayer.

From [Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible commentary](https://biblehub.com/commentaries/1_timothy/4-5.htm) 

> '"by means of intercessory prayer" (so the Greek)—that is, consecratory prayer in behalf of "the creature" or food'

Although the eucharist is the supreme example of our food taking on a different quality, every other meal can in a lesser way likewise seem to have that effect.

> "Just as in the Lord's Supper, the thanksgiving prayer sanctifies the elements, separating them from their naturally alien position in relation to the spiritual world, and transferring them to their true relation to the new life.
> So in every use of the creature, thanksgiving prayer has the same effect, and ought always to be used (1Co 10:30, 31)."

How wonderful is that!

The inclusion of the phrase, "the word of God", according to most commentaries, either mean:

1. That the word of God is used in the prayer, for example phrases built using scripture.
2. That the prayer rests on the foundation of the word of God, which declares all foods to be clean and a gift from God.

In my view, both can be held to without making too much about it, since both are good general principles to follow.

From conversation with Stephan:

- In the past, food was made appropriate (sanctified/made holy) to be eaten by the priests in the Levitical system (old covenant).
- It would make sense that for the new covenant priesthood of believers, food would also be 'set apart'.
- This happens, however, not by the food itself or the handling thereof, but by a spiritual act: thanksgiving.
- This thanksgiving is based on the word of God and would benefit from using its language.

Other scriptures that have implications on the act of thanksgiving:

- **Psalm 145:15-16** | The eyes of all look to you, and you give them their food in due season.
  You open your hand; you satisfy the desire of every living thing.
- **Matthew 14:19** | Then he ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass, and taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and said a blessing.
  Then he broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.
- **Matthew 15:36** | he took the seven loaves and the fish, and having given thanks he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.
- **Luke 22:17-19** | 17 And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he said, “Take this, and divide it among yourselves.
  18 For I tell you that from now on I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.”
  19 And he took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to them, saying, “This is my body, which is given for you.
  Do this in remembrance of me.”
- **Acts 10:15** | And the voice came to him again a second time, “What God has made clean, do not call common.”
- **Acts 27:35** | And when he had said these things, he took bread, and giving thanks to God in the presence of all he broke it and began to eat.
- **1 Cor 10:30** | If I partake with thankfulness, why am I denounced because of that for which I give thanks?

## Reflections on 1 Cor 10:27-33

**1 Cor 10:27-33**

_27 If one of the unbelievers invites you to dinner and you are disposed to go,_
_eat whatever is set before you without raising any question on the ground of conscience._
_28 But if someone says to you, “This has been offered in sacrifice,” then do not eat it,_
_for the sake of the one who informed you, and for the sake of conscience—_
_29 I do not mean your conscience, but his._
_For why should my liberty be determined by someone else's conscience?_
_30 If I partake with thankfulness, why am I denounced because of that for which I give thanks?_
_31 So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God._
_32 Give no offense to Jews or to Greeks or to the church of God,_
_33 just as I try to please everyone in everything I do,_
_not seeking my own advantage, but that of many, that they may be saved._

The difficulty in this passage is verse 29.
As [Barnes](https://biblehub.com/commentaries/1_corinthians/10-29.htm) puts it:

> "There is much difficulty in this clause; for as it now stands, it seems to be entirely contradictory to what the apostle had been saying."

Seems like it's either an objection that is being quoted as if from a Corinthian church member:

> "why should my liberty be determined by someone else's conscience?
> If I partake with thankfulness, why am I denounced because of that for which I give thanks?"

It's likely either that or Paul is saying something along lines of "Unless my conscience bears witness to me that I shouldn't, I will partake of that which is set before me.
I won't try and gauge every single person's conscience who is at the table in an over-the-top way, where (having considered them all already) I (for example) ask them 'does this affect your conscience?'."

As Barnes further states, quoting a paraphrase from Doddridge:

> "I speak only of acts obvious to human observation: for as to what immediately lies between God and my own soul, why is my liberty to be judged, arraigned, condemned at the bar of another man's conscience?"

In other words, Paul is explaining why he can eat the meat offered to idols in verse 27, even if the unbeliever might have a conscience issue.
However, when it is made known ("obvious to human observation"), then use your freedom to abstain.

## Reflections on suffering from Hebrews 5:8 and Romans 5:3-5

Why is there suffering in the life of a believer?

Suffering is a unique instrument in the hand of God, used to produce two things from these passages:

1. Learning environment for obedience
2. Endurance (which in turn produces character, which in turn produces hope)

Suffering is where we learn obedience.
In stead of just wishing it away, we should seek answer "what does obedience look like in this time?".

At least according to James 5:13, and the example of Jesus in Gethsemane, it should be a time of prayer.

## Reflections on James 5:14-16

_14 Is anyone among you sick?_
_Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord._
_15 And the prayer of faith will save the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up._
_And if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven._
_16 Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, that you may be healed._
_The prayer of a righteous person has great power as it is working._

We are instructed to pray for people that the Lord might raise them up.
In this way we re-enact the pattern of death followed by resurrection, which is the Lord's doing.
This re-enactment brings glory to God by being a witness to Christ.

So how does praying and confessing contribute to this, or why does God require it as part of this work of resurrection?
Maybe confession is part of it because that which God wants to resurrect must be blameless.
If we confess our sins, God is faithful to cleanse us.
That which is cleansed is proper to be resurrected, that which is filthy should die.

Prayer is probably required because of the implicit way it puts trust in God rather than the works of man.
Jesus prayed to the Father before His resurrection, on multiple times, the last one being the commending of His spirit into the Father's hands.

As with Christ, we might be in situations where salvation or deliverance is possible by our own hands, just like He was able to call upon angels and end the entire mock trial.
Yet if we spent time with the Father, we could discern that He intends for us to drink the cup, not work our way out of it.
This will point to our faith in Him, that we entrust Him to raise us up and deliver us rather than seeking to deliver ourselves.

However, it's not always like this, and we must discern.
Jesus also escaped the hands of those who wanted to throw Him off the cliff, because His time has not yet come.
In many situations, He got out of trials by reasoning from the scriptures.
Like Paul, we might have to climb in a basket so that our friends can let us down the wall to safety, rather than waiting on God to change the situation supernaturally.

God is going to bring us to places where we will die.
It will be uncomfortable, and we'll wish to avoid it.
But in that place there will be the opportunity for resurrection, for our benefit and to the glory of God.
This will prepare us for the final death and resurrection, where we'll have good confidence and faith in God that he'll raise us again as He has been faithful to do many times before.

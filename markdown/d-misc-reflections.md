## Prayers on the cross

There is so much richness and depth in the example of Christ both before and during His crucifixion.

The prayers on the cross provide a great framework of how we can also pray during times of persecution and suffering.

1. Forgiveness for our enemies.
2. Godly/scriptural lamentation.
3. Trust in God.

Maybe it is only after we have prayed 1 and 2 that we will be able to have processed the emotions of heart and prepared ourself for 3.

## Reflections on Colossians 1:9

It seems to me that the natural expected fruit of growing maturity in Christ is thanksgiving and joy, both of which are not grounded in the things that pass away, but in that which is to come (eternal).
We all desire to be in a state of joy, but the only means we can access it in our natural state is through favorable circumstances and physical pleasures (food, sex, alcohol), both of which affect our emotions.

It is necessary to be careful here because the Bible doesn't make joy the entry point to the gospel or a reason for proclaiming it.
However, for those who are saved, Paul clearly wants them to be joyful and thankful.
It's just that he wants them to be joyful and thankful for the right reasons.

The prosperity gospel is in contradicting Paul on this point, since it uses the means of the natural man (favorable circumstances and physical pleasures) to get people to a state of joy.
In stead of putting people's minds on the things above, it puts it on the things below.

The words "endurance" and "patience" assumes unfavorable circumstances for the natural man, but the word "joy" assumes favorable circumstances for the spiritual man.
Probably what James had in mind when he wrote "count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trails of various kinds".

## Reflections on 1 Thessalonians 5:16-18

_16 Rejoice always,_
_17 pray without ceasing,_
_18 give thanks in all circumstances;_
_for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you._

Paul is teaching what he is practicing.

This is evident from the close parallel with 1 Thessalonians 3:9-10:

- _For what thanksgiving can we return to God for you,_ (give thanks in all circumstances)
- _for all the joy that we feel for your sake before our God,_ (rejoice always)
- _10 as we pray most earnestly night and day_ (pray without ceasing)

If asking for God's will for a specific matter in our life is like asking which window to use in a house, then obeying this passage (and others such as 1 Thessalonians 4:3) is like the foundation.
We can't be thinking too much about the window if the foundation isn't laid.

Let us first ensure we get this 'basic' in place and have it solidified, before we move on to other things.
This establishes the supremacy of God's will above our own, and will surely better prepare us for discerning more secondary things.

Even in a workplace, a manager will refrain from giving people instructions for a task if they are not executing sufficiently on the instructions for a prior task.

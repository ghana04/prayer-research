# Colossians

## Colossians 1:3-4 | Paul thanks God for their faith and love

_3 We always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you,_
_4 since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love that you have for all the saints,_

- **Beneficiaries:** Church in Colossae
- **Content:** Thanksgiving and supplication
- **Manner:** With thanksgiving
- **To whom:** God the Father
- **When:** Always
- **Why:** The prayer generally is probably for their growth as believers (cf. 4:12).
  The thanksgiving part of the prayer is however directly tied to their faith and their love for all the saints.

The maturity of Paul is staggering, he is rejoicing and thanking God because of the faith of the church and their love towards other believers.
He is also not shy to say that he prays for them, something that although done in secret is spoken of to encourage and probably disciple the Colossians: we are a people who pray for one another.

## Colossians 1:9 | Paul's unceasing prayer for knowledge and power

_9 And so, from the day we heard, we have not ceased to pray for you,_
_asking that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,_
_10 so as to walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing to him:_
_bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God;_
_11 being strengthened with all power, according to his glorious might,_
_for all endurance and patience with joy;_
_12 giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in light._

- **Beneficiaries:** Church in Colossae
- **Content:** Supplication
- **Manner:** Unceasingly
- **Where:** The location aspect.
- **Why:** The background/context for the prayer to occur.

It's interesting that Paul states the content of his prayer to the Colossians.
He makes it clear, 'this is what I have on my heart for you', and it has nothing to do with earthly things, but that which pertain to their holiness.

Two primary requests:

1. Knowledge: "that you may be filled with knowledge" (also "increasing in the knowledge of God")
2. Power: "being strengthened with all power"

The result of these being: 

- Walking in a manner worthy of the Lord.
- Bearing fruit.
- Having endurance and patience with joy.
- Giving thanks.

Even as Paul gives thanks to the Father for their faith and love, he prays that they also may give thanks to the Father.
However, for them it seems that he links it more to their inheritance.
He would surely also then pray for them what he does for the Ephesians, that they would know the hope and glorious inheritance that God has for the saints (Eph 1:18).

## Colossians 4:2 | Be watchful in prayer and give thanks

_2 Continue steadfastly in prayer, being watchful in it with thanksgiving._

- **Beneficiaries:** Unspecified
- **Content:** Supplication and thanksgiving
- **Manner:** Steadfast, watchful, and with thanksgiving
- **To whom:** Unspecified
- **Why:** Unspecified

Assuming Jesus' last night in the garden of Gethsemane as backdrop, the watchfulness here probably also has the same idea of "watch and pray, that you may not enter into temptation".
Our time of prayer is supposed to be the time of alertness, being awake.
When we close our natural eyes in prayer our spiritual eyes should be open to seek the Lord's grace.

Also for Paul, it is again imperative that our relationship with God be one characterized by thankfulness.
From Col 3:15-17, we see that thankfulness should be our state of being (v. 15), that it should be toward God (v. 16), and that we express it toward the Father through Christ (v. 17).
In fact, in everything we do, we should do it while giving thanks to the Father.

## Colossians 4:3 | Paul's request for prayer for an open door

_3 At the same time, pray also for us, that God may open to us a door for the word, to declare the mystery of Christ, on account of which I am in prison --_
_4 that I may make it clear, which is how I ought to speak._

- **Beneficiaries:** Paul and his companions
- **Content:** Supplication ("that God may open")
- **To whom:** God.
- **When:** While praying generally (v. 2)
- **Why:** For the proclamation of Christ, that it would be clear

Interesting that in the dynamics between Paul and the people of Colossae, it seems the he and his companions pray for them for growth, whilst asking them to pray for their work.

## Colossians 4:12 | Epaphras' struggle in his prayers

_12 Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ Jesus, greets you,_
_always struggling on your behalf in his prayers,_
_that you may stand mature and fully assured in all the will of God._

- **Beneficiaries:** The church at Colossae
- **Content:** That God would grant something general.
- **Manner:** Struggling
- **When:** Always
- **Why:** That the church may be "mature and fully assured in al the will of God"

Surely this idea of struggling in prayer is what Paul had in mind in Colossians 2:1.
It seems that Paul and his disciples were constantly in prayer on behalf of others, and that this was a struggle of sorts.

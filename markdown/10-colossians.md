# Colossians

## Colossians 1:3-4 | Paul thanks God for their faith and love

_3 We always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you,_
_4 since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love that you have for all the saints,_

- **Beneficiaries:** Church in Colossae
- **Content:** Thanksgiving and supplication
- **Manner:** With thanksgiving
- **To whom:** God the Father
- **When:** Always
- **Why:** The prayer generally is probably for their growth as believers (cf. 4:12).
  The thanksgiving part of the prayer is however directly tied to their faith and their love for all the saints.

The maturity of Paul is staggering, he is rejoicing and thanking God because of the faith of the church and their love towards other believers.
He is also not shy to say that he prays for them, something that although done in secret is spoken of to encourage and probably disciple the Colossians: we are a people who pray for one another.

## Colossians 1:9

_9 And so, from the day we heard, we have not ceased to pray for you,_
_asking that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,_
_10 so as to walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing to him:_
_bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God;_
_11 being strengthened with all power, according to his glorious might,_
_for all endurance and patience with joy;_
_12 giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in light._

- **Beneficiaries:** Church in Colossae
- **Content:** Supplication
- **Manner:** Unceasingly
- **Where:** The location aspect.
- **Why:** The background/context for the prayer to occur.

It's interesting that Paul states the content of his prayer to the Colossians.
He makes it clear, 'this is what I have on my heart for you', and it has nothing to do with earthly things, but that which pertain to their holiness.

Two primary requests:

1. Knowledge: "that you may be filled with knowledge" (also "increasing in the knowledge of God")
2. Power: "being strengthened with all power"

The result of these being: 

- Walking in a manner worthy of the Lord.
- Bearing fruit.
- Having endurance and patience with joy.
- Giving thanks.

Even as Paul gives thanks to the Father for their faith and love, he prays that they also may give thanks to the Father.
However, for them it seems that he links it more to their inheritance.
He would surely also then pray for them what he does for the Ephesians, that they would know the hope and glorious inheritance that God has for the saints (Eph 1:18).
